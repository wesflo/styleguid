# GIT Working Guide

## Workflow

- Use Git flow. <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">See branching model</a>.

- Create your features with Ticket Prefix.

   ```
    TICKET1234_shortDescription
    ```

- Do commit early and often.

- Push your stuff at least 2 times a day and always when you finish your working day.

- Do make useful commit messages.
    Creating insightful and descriptive commit messages is one of the best things you can do for others who use the repository. It lets people quickly understand changes without having to read code.
